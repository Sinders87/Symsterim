//The setting is in an alternate universe Japan that was fused with our own Japan. Each artifact was a rare or unique item from our Earth. The final artifact is a clock from our world that transports you back in time. Once there, you find the cause of all the trouble. A "cursed" swordmaker accidentally made a sword so sharp that it cut through into a chaotic alternate reality set in the far future. Robots are sentient beings that have decided to eliminate all organic life. They are shadowy beasts because they weren't meant to be in this universe.
